from q and a
think about local events 
integration with existing marketplaces (hooooow)
ability to make purchase + add donation in same transaction
sell services as well
how are we going to get this in people? have people inventory their house, then encourage to give to charity? social aspect, collision of buyers and sellers, appeal to chairity minded people, looking for disruption, how to defend it from others?
how to convince people this is legit? marketing keep reinforcing through ui/ux where proceeds go
no rewards for customers 
leaderboard with opt-out feature for public recognition
has to be credit card or e-check
refund system? just in case, yes
police the system
make a quiz for which kind of charity you should donate to
featured charities

use guidestar api


my ideas:
gamification - have categories of charities, achievements based on how much donated to which kind of charities
need to target baby boomers who aren't tech savy, don't trust/understand apps - can't rely on just kids selling their stuff
outreach also important, who cares if no one uses it
cluster sort types of charities
seller trust, rating system like uber
make charities apply to be in it for extra credibility
