from q and a
think about local events 
integration with existing marketplaces (hooooow)
ability to make purchase + add donation in same transaction
sell services as well



my ideas:
gamification - have categories of charities, achievements based on how much donated to which kind of charities
need to target baby boomers who aren't tech savy, don't trust/understand apps - can't rely on just kids selling their stuff
outreach also important, who cares if no one uses it
